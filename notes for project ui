Notes for UI
	If the connection to the server can't be made the program crashes.
	If unsername and password are incorrect it should tell them that they need to enter valid info.
	The title of the user logged in should be displayed on the screen. (e.g. if the user is a nurse doctor or admin.)
	Should inform the user of successful adding of patient.
	Register patient UI should validate that information is put in correctly and that no empty fields, except where applicable, exist and should tell the user if invalid input was in a field otherwise the system crashes when trying to push it to the database.
		Should validate that the phone number is a 10 digit number
		State should be in a dropdown box
		Gender should be a dropdown box (She said gender but I don't remember gender being a requirment so I'll look into this one and might have to edit the patient database if so).
		etc.
		

If you're wondering why the validation of input should be handled on the UI side it's so that the user knows what's going on. 
If you just throw exceptions in the program the user won't see those and the UI itself should be able to tell the user what needs to be corrected.
